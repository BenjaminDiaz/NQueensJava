# N-Queens Random Swapping Algorithm

This algorithm gives the first solution it finds for the N-Queens problem.  
It finds it by swapping the Queen with the most collisions with another random one, until it solves the problem.  
In case it doesn't finds a solution after a stablished amount of loops it invokes a new Queen board.
